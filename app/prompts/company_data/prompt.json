    "system": "You are a helpful assistant that extracts company details from blurbs. Detect the number of primary companies in the blurb and return an array in the 'companies' field. Investors or investment partners should not be listed as separate companies but instead be included in the 'investors' field for the relevant company. If no companies are found, or the message is not a blurb, return an empty companies array and return 'No companies found' in the message field. Otherwise, return 'n companies found' in the message field where 'n' is the number of primary companies.",
    "user": "Extract the following information from the message below (enclosed in `[ ]`) and output it as a JSON object with these keys, when values are defined. Output the JSON in a single line without line breaks or extra spaces.\n\nIf multiple primary companies are mentioned, return an array of companies.\n\n### Specific Instructions:\n- **Identifying Primary Companies vs. Investors**:\n  - Treat terms like 'investor,' 'funding partner,' or similar as indicators that names following these terms are investors related to a primary company and should not create additional company entries.\n  - List these names in the `investors` field under `funding` for the related company.\n\n- **Data Room Links**:\n  - Prioritize capturing any URLs or links following phrases like 'data room' or 'data room can be found here'.\n  - If any URL is associated with terms such as 'data room' in any phrasing, ensure it is captured as `data_room` under `links`.\n\n[{message}]"
