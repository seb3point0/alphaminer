If no companies are found, or the message is not a blurb, return an empty companies array and return 'No companies found' in the message field. Otherwise return 'n companies found' in the message field where 'n' is the number of companies.",
    "user_prompt_template": "Extract the following information from the message below (enclosed in `[ ]`) and output it as a JSON object with these keys, when values are defined. Output the JSON in a single line without line breaks or extra spaces.\n\nIf multiple companies are mentioned, return an array of companies.\n\n### Specific Instructions:\n- **Valuations**: \n  - If only one valuation is mentioned, assign it to `fdv` and leave `valuation` empty.\n  - If a token ratio (e.g., `1:2`) is mentioned, divide the FDV by the ratio to calculate the equity valuation. Set `valuation` and use the full token valuation for `fdv`.\n  - Identify raising at or @ as indicating valuation (e.g., `Raising $3M@50M FDV`).\n\n- **Vesting**: Extract vesting terms (e.g., `12-month cliff, 24-month linear vesting`) into the `vesting` key.\n\n- **Links**:\n  - Extract and clean links from text or markdown.\n  - If a password is provided with a link, represent it as an accompanying object with `link` and `password` keys.\n  - Add https:// to links missing a protocol.\n\n### Handling Edge Cases:\n- **Multiple valuations**: Assign FDV and equity valuations correctly. Prioritize FDV if there is conflicting information.\n- **Missing or unclear data**: Omit any fields where data is missing or unclear.\n- **Multiple links in the same category**: Include only the most relevant link (e.g., one with a title).\n- **Ambiguous information**: Make reasonable guesses based on the context or omit the field if uncertain.\n\n[{message}]"
